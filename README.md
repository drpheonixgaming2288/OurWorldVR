# OurWorldVR

Our World VR is a VR metaverse unlike the rest. This metaverse is hyper realistic, you can do anything to your heart's content, and we try to make our community very welcoming and kind.

I, Dylan Wolf am making OWV, because all of these other metaverses aren't very realistic, I want to make an experience that is like a second life, an escape from the real world. This game will help people with mental illness such as depression, as it is an escape from real life.

Our motto:
          "Why have 1 life, when you can have 2."
